This project was not just about coding but also about learning. I refined my backend and frontend skills, delved deep into system design, and enhanced my understanding of complex, scalable architectures. 

Here's a video showcasing my work on both the backend and frontend:

## *Before trying the Website* 
### *Cold Start :* 
I am using free service of render of after a period of inactivity render automatically spin down to conserve resources so the first request after a period of inactivity can take significantly longer, often 50 seconds or more, as the instance has to "wake up."
To handle this problem i am using a Keep Alive Server Technique using UptimeRobot
